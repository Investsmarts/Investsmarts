    <h2>Automated System Operation</h2>
    <p>
      TrustDollar operates through automated systems.
      All mining activity, reward calculations, and distributions
      are processed digitally without manual control.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule-box">
    <h2>Mining & Earnings Logic</h2>
    <p>
      Mining rewards are generated based on system activity.
      Users may start or stop mining at any time.
      When mining is stopped, a portion of the earned rewards
      is credited to the user according to system rules.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule-box">
    <h2>Reward Distribution Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Upon stopping mining, 70% of the generated rewards
      are credited to the user.
      The remaining portion is distributed automatically
      within the team structure based on predefined levels.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule-box">
    <h2>Team & Referral Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      Referral and team rewards are granted only to eligible
      and active accounts.
      Uplines must maintain the required balance to receive
      downline mining benefits.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule-box">
    <h2>Fair Usage Policy</h2>
    <p>
      Duplicate accounts, artificial activity, or system manipulation
      are not permitted.
      Any detected misuse may result in restriction
      to protect platform integrity.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="rule-box">
    <h2>Transparency Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      TrustDollar is committed to transparency.
      System logs are monitored regularly,
      and rules may be updated to improve security
      and long-term sustainability.
    </p>
